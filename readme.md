# Raw Microarray/RNA-Seq Data Processing Pipelines

## Introduction

Microarray and RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) technologies are widely used to measure gene expression levels.  The raw data generated by these technologies is often stored in various formats, including .CEL, .IDAT, .TXT, .gpr, and .fpkm_tracking.  These raw files contain gene expression information but require significant preprocessing before they can be used for meaningful biological interpretation. This project provides a pipeline for processing these raw data files and generating a gene expression matrix (samples x genes), which is the foundation for downstream biological and computational analyses.

## Relevance of Raw Data Processing

Raw data files often contain noise, batch effects, and other artifacts that can obscure true biological signals.  Proper preprocessing is essential to remove these unwanted variations and ensure that the resulting expression matrix accurately reflects the true levels of gene expression across samples.  This processing is critical for:

* **Removal of Technical Biases:** Normalization techniques remove the effects of experimental variations, allowing for meaningful comparisons across samples and studies.
* **Enhanced Reproducibility:** Standardized processing ensures that results can be compared and reproduced across different experiments and labs.
* **Improved Data Quality:** Quality control steps identify and remove low-quality probes or samples, increasing the confidence in gene expression measurements.
* **Facilitating Downstream Analysis:** A clean and properly formatted expression matrix is required for downstream analyses such as differential expression analysis, clustering, classification, and pathway enrichment.

## Project Objective

This project aims to:

1. Process raw microarray and RNA-Seq data files.
2. Gene Mapping
3. Generate a gene expression matrix (samples x genes) suitable for downstream analysis.

## Supported File Types

This project processes raw microarray data (.CEL, .IDAT) and RNA-Seq data (.TXT, .gpr, .fpkm_tracking) files.

## Tools and Libraries Used

This project uses R-programming language and packages such as dplyr, readr, stringr, biomaRt, affy, oligo, Biobase, annotate, hgu133plus2.db, minfi, illuminaio, IlluminaHumanMethylationEPICmanifest and IlluminaHumanMethylationEPICanno.ilm10b4.hg19.

## Input Format

In this project, 5 different types of input files are used such CEL, IDAT, TXT, gpr and .fpkm_tracking.

## Output Format

The output is a gene expression matrix in in CSV format in which samples are as column names and gene names are as row names.
